## Introduction

The **SfM-2** model is the first of its kind, designed to enhance productivity for developers using the Sona programming language. By integrating deep learning techniques with natural language processing (NLP), SfM-2 enables users to generate code with a high level of accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- **Custom Transformer Architecture**: Tailored specifically for Sona, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Native Syntax Understanding**: Recognizes and processes Sona's syntax, allowing for more accurate code generation.
- **Semantic Code Generation**: Generates code that is not only syntactically correct but also semantically meaningful.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands and clear output make it easy for developers to interact with the model.
- **Research-Oriented**: Designed for those interested in exploring the intersection of AI and programming languages.

## Architecture

The architecture of SfM-2 is built on a custom transformer model. This model leverages attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input code, ensuring that the generated output aligns closely with the intended functionality. The following components are integral to the architecture:

- **Input Embedding Layer**: Converts Sona code into a format suitable for processing.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Highlights important tokens and structures in the code.
- **Decoder Layer**: Generates the final output based on the processed input.

## Installation

To install **SfM-2**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Watdafuc220/SfM-2.git
   cd SfM-2
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the latest model from the [Releases](https://github.com/Watdafuc220/SfM-2/releases) section. You need to download and execute the model files to get started.

## Usage

Using **SfM-2** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can generate code using the model:

1. Import the model in your Python script:
   ```python
   from sfm2 import SFM2Model
   ```

2. Initialize the model:
   ```python
   model = SFM2Model()
   ```

3. Generate code by providing a prompt:
   ```python
   prompt = "Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number."
   generated_code = model.generate_code(prompt)
   print(generated_code)
   ```

4. Review the output, which will be a valid Sona code snippet based on your prompt.
